# 1. ADR-0001 RoadWarrior Basic Architecture 
<!-- Architecture Decision Record for relevant/important architecture or design decisions with product, cross product or platforms. The general purpose is to make the problem statement, conflicting requirements and analyzed solutions explicit. Use for important decisions and focus on essential information and diagramming. -->

## 1.1 Context and Problem Statement

The target is to build an online trip management application to allow travelers to manage their trips and see all of their existing reservations.
Access to the RoadWarrior 

[Describe the context and problem statement, e.g., in free form using two to three sentences. You may want to articulate the problem in form of a question. Provide background on user journey or challenge that needs to be implemented?]

[Provide relevant diagram for decision, focus on essential information for described problem. examples: Delimit your system, define boundaries and describe external interfaces with context diagram. Provide static decomposition of the product or platform in scope with building block view. Provide runtime view if required with sequence diagram]

## 1.2 Decision Drivers

[provide insight into current drivers or concerns which triggered decision need. Provide 2-3 lines per driver]

### 1.2.1 Architecture Principles

Bayer principles on Enterprise Architecture: [EA Principles](https://bayergroup.sharepoint.com/sites/ArchitectureHub/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FArchitectureHub%2FShared%20Documents%2FArchitecture%20Artifacts%2FEA%5FPrinciples%5FOne%5FPager%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FArchitectureHub%2FShared%20Documents%2FArchitecture%20Artifacts)

Bayer principles for Cloud Native and SaaS usage: [Cloud Principles](https://bayergroup.sharepoint.com/sites/ArchitectureHub/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B0D008775-857C-41C3-87ED-AA7AF2E32097%7D&file=2021-12-09%20-%20Cloud%20Principles.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

[ Provide relevant Architecture Principles which require consideration for problem statement. Choose from above linked Bayer principles and provide 2-3 lines per relevant/focus principle]

### 1.2.2 Quality Requirements
Quality Requirements: [ISO2510](https://iso25000.com/index.php/en/iso-25000-standards/iso-25010)

[Please provide infomration on relevant quality requirements, like throughput, latency, availability or security requirements. Highlight most relevant topics for the architecture options]

## 1.3 Considered Options and Decision Outcome

[Provide summary of considered options as one liners and provide reasoning for  selected option, based on above Problem Statement, Architecture principles and considered Quality Requirements.]

* [option 1]
* [option 2]
* [option 3]
* … <!-- numbers of options can vary -->

Chosen option: "[option 1]", because [justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver, satisfies quality criteria, etc.].

## 1.4 Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

[Highlight business benefits, technical impact and possible new technical debts]

### 1.4.2 [option 2]

[Short description of scetchd solution]

* Good, because [argument a]
* Good, because [argument b]
* Bad, because [argument c]

### 1.4.3 [option 3]

[Short description of scetchd solution]

* Good, because [argument a]
* Good, because [argument b]
* Bad, because [argument c] 
* … <!-- numbers of pros and cons can vary -->
