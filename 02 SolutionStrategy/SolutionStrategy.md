# Solution Strategy
This Document provides a high level overview of the to be architecture for the Warrior application. It is intended to serve as fundation to ensure joint understanding how the defined problem of the traveler domain will translate into a solution, which takes architecture constraints and architectire principles into accont.

## Solution Strategy
(containing architecture goals and their supportive architecture approaches)
- leading ideas/concepts
  - service architecture
  - decoupeling via message - address architecture characteristics per service
  - one databayse per service

## Architecture Principles

- Build in the cloud, build cloud native solutions
- Design for modular landscape, we balance loose coulpling and coherence
- Design for external integration, we allow to connect to a growing eco system
- Design for the entire lifecycle, we design for maintainability of technologues, applications and data
- Design for Security and Compliance, we ensure legal constraints and ensure external regulations by design.

## Informal Overview Diagram

The following diagram provides insights into the overall contexts and respective services and components for the Warrior application. It provides a scetch of the communication and interaction patterns required for cross context communication and external communication with agencies.
